Mimic is currently being developed and maintained by Mycroft AI, Inc.
Mycroft AI is the company behind the Mycroft artificial intelligence
and voice assistant platform, more info here: https://mycroft.ai

The initial development of Mimic was primarily done by awb through
the Flite project while he was traveling, perhaps the name is
doubly appropriate as a substantial amount of the coding was
done over 30,000ft). During most of that time awb was funded
by the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University.

Kevin A. Lenzo was involved in the design, conversion techniques and
representations for the voice distributed with Flite (as well as being
the actual kal voice itself).

The main contributions to mimic-english are based on the English flite support,
supported by:

University of Edinburgh
   for releasing Festival for free, making a companion runtime synthesizer
   a practical project, much of the design of flite relies on the
   architecture decisions made in the Festival Speech Synthesis Systems and
   the Edinburgh Speech Tools.
   The duration cart tree and intonation (accent and F0) models were
   derived from the models in the Festival distribution. which in turn
   were trained from the Boston University FM Radio Data Corpus.
Carnegie Mellon University
   The included lexicon is derived from CMULEX and the letter to sound
   rules are constructed using the Lenzo and Black techniques for
   building LTS decision graphs.
